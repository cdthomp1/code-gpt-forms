<!-- PROMPT: Create for me JavaScript code that can take in arbitrary JSON file from the user and convert it to a form and save the data to an API call. The JSON might have nested objects so the code should handle that.  Add some validation to the form. Create HTML to display the form. The form inputs should be placed on the left side of the page and the form outputs should be displayed on the right side of the page. Add some styles in CSS  to make the form and the outputs look nice.  -->
