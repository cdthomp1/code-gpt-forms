Create for me an angular app that takes in a json file as configuration to create a contact form. Here is the json file: 
{
    "form-name": "Simple Contact Form",
    "form-fields": [{
        "field-name": "First Name",
        "field-type": "text"
    },
    {
        "field-name": "Last Name",
        "field-type": "text"
    },{
        "field-name": "Email",
        "field-type": "email"
    },
    {
        "field-name": "Phone Number",
        "field-type": "tel"
    },
    {
        "field-name": "Comments",
        "field-type": "textarea"
    }]
}
Use the array of form fields to create the different form elements. Display the input of the form on the right of the form. The form should be a reactive form.
